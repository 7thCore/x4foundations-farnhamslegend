# Sector Farnham's Legend Relocation Patch Beta
Save compatibility: Yes

# What does it do:
This patch moves the sector Farnham's Legend to a new location to make the mod compatible with other mods. It also removes the Windfall Gate and changes the highway connection route to not have them go through multiple sectors in the map overview. Connections are now between Pious Mists II and Pontifex's Claim. The Gate connection between Hatikvah's Choice I and Silent Witness I is restored.

# WARNING:
Only use one relocation patch. The Relocation patches have special scripts built in them to detect each other. If multiple patches are enabled you will get a warning on screen and after twenty seconds a Game Over sign. This is to prevent conflicts between the patches.
