# Sector Farnham's Legend X Universe + Compatibility patch
Save compatibility: Yes

# What does it do:
This mod moves the sector Farnham's Legend to a new location to make the mod compatible with the mod X Universe +. It also changes the location of the Windfall Gate and changes the highway connection route to not have them go through multiple sectors in the map overview. Connections are now between Argon Prime and Second Contact II Flashpoint. The Gate connection between Hatikvah's Choice I and Silent Witness I is restored.

# Disclamer:
I do not own and I am not involved with the development of the X Universe + mod. All credit for the X Universe + mod goes to it's developer J.L.

# Original Mod:
