# Sector Farnham's Legend Legacy
Save compatibility: Yes

# What does it do:
This patch is for users who's saved games are before the update to the resource fields. No longer are all resources available in all sectors with the current version of the mod but the in-game encyclopedia still lists them and the AI miners still want to mine for them. This will fix that issue by adding the resources back to those sectors. If you start a new game, I strongly advise to disable this patch.
