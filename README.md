# Sector Farnham's Legend Legacy
Save compatibility: Yes

# What does it do:
This mod adds a new sector between Hatikvah's Choice and Silent Witness.

The sector has it's own gate to gate highway and is connected to the ring highway through the gates of Hatikvah's Choice and Silent Witness. There is also a gate connection to Windfall III The Hoard, located in the south portion of the sector Farnham's Legend V. The resource fields are below the gates, highways and stations to not interfere with them. The sector has faction logic disabled, so you can take it over and build your own stations in it freely.

This is the legacy version that has all resources available in all sectors.
